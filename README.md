# VAHAKA - Electric Scooter Simulator for Automotive Cybersecurity Practice

## 🚦 About VAHAKA

The name **VAHAKA** (वाहक) is derived from ancient Indian Sanskrit manuscripts, where it means **"carrier" or "vehicle"**. The term symbolizes a medium of movement—perfectly aligning with our mission to offer a dynamic and educational platform for exploring mobility-related cybersecurity threats and defenses.

## 📥 Installation
### Prerequisites : 
To successfully install and run Vahaka on your Linux system, you need to have :
- NodeJS (at-least version 22.13.1)
- NPM (at-least version 11.1.0)
Note :
- If your system does not have NodeJS installed, the installation script attempts to install the latest version of Node on your system, but if your system already has a lower, unsupported version of Node - the installation script will NOT try to update it (since it can affect your other projects). In this case, you will have to manually update Node and NPM.
- Vahaka might run on Node versions earlier to the mentioned minimums, but this is not guaranteed.
### Method 1 - Using Installation Script
*(Creates a symlink)*
- Run this command in your Linux terminal : 
```bash
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dellon-Technology-Pvt-Ltd/Vahaka/refs/heads/main/install.sh | bash
```
- Once installation is successful, start Vahaka from anywhere using the command 
```bash
vahaka
```

### Method 2 - Cloning the Repo
*(Creates no symlink, but you need to be in the Vahaka directory to run)*
- Clone the repository at your desired location :
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dellon-Technology-Pvt-Ltd/Vahaka.git
```
*(Or download and extract the .ZIP file)*
- Install the prerequisites (in the Vahaka directory) :
```
npm install
```
- Start Vahaka server by running :
```bash
node server.js
```
